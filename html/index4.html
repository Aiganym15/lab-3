            <h2>Jenny Gerhardt</h2>
            <p>Theodore Dreiser's Jennie Gerhardt (1911) follows the plight of a socially disadvantaged woman whose love affairs with wealthy men put her in
                 stressful situations, but enable her to survive all the same. Jennie is a victim and critics define her as "weak-willed," 
                 but the story reveals that every character is a victim of circumstance in some way: Lester to the expectations of an affluent society, Jennie to her romantic sensibilities, William and his family to their immigrant status and poverty.</p>
